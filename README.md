# Data augmentation for X-Ray pneumonia detection
This is a notebook to verify if data augmentation can help better the pneumonia detection performance. 

My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a model capable of predicting whether an X-ray image indicates pneumonia or not. Then, we apply data augmentation to see if we get better results.


### Methods Used
* Computer vision
* Deep Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Analysis
* Data preprocessing
